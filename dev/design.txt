Password creator

type secret = bytes

type passphrase = string

type formatter = secret -> passphrase
  A formatter renders a secret into printable format for use as a passphrase.

type generator = (address, seed) -> secret
  A generator combines an address and a seed to produce a secret.

Operation:
 formatter(generator(address, seed)) ==> passphrase

Notes:
1. The seed may be random, or may depend on the login name, e.g.,
   seed = hash(random | id).  The seed may be stored as configuration.

2. The address needs to be normalized somehow; for a URL, the query and 
   any fragments should be stripped off.  What about the path?

3. There need to be rules for formatting.
   a. Length restrictions (>= 6 characters, < 8 characters).
   b. Composition rules (at least one letter, letters/digits, punctuation).
   c. Character set (letters, digits, spaces, punctuation).

Top-level interface:
   password_for(site_key, master_secret) ==> "<password>"

Configurations:
 - Length of output password (characters).
 - Limitations on password alphabet.
 - Index number for password.

-- Alphabet

Passwords will be written in printable ASCII characters only.  The alphabets
include upper and lower case letters (26 each), the ten decimal digits (10),
the "safe" punctuation (17)

The punctuation marks considered "safe" are:
 ! @ # $ % ^ & * - _ = + , . : / ?

Notably, no string quotes, parentheses, brackets, semi-colons, or other items
that are syntactic structure markers in common programming languages, and thus
might run into escaping or validation rules.

-- Length

Each password should be as long as is allowed by the site.  Sometimes it's hard
to know in advance what a site will allow, so length will be a parameter with a
default value.

-- Index

To allow passwords to change over time, each site password will incorporate an
index label, which acts as a salt for the hashing algorithm.  The default will
be the string consisting of the single character "1" and can be replaced by the
user to get a new password for the same site settings at any time.
