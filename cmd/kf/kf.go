Various commands accept a query to identify which record or records to
operate on. A query has the form [tag@]label. The label is either the unique
label assigned to a record, a full or partial match for one of the hostnames
associated with the record, or a substring match for the title or notes
field of the record.

Matching records are ranked from most to least specific:

 1. An exact match on the record label.
 2. An exact match on a hostname of the record.
 3. A partial (suffix) match on a hostname of the record.
 4. A substring match on the title.
 5. A substring match on the label of a detail.
 6. A substring match in some other text field.

A command that requires a single record will select the highest-ranked
unique result. If no such record exists, the command will report an error
listing the candidate records that could have been chosen.`,
