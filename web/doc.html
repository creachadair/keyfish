<p>KeyFish lets you generate a unique password for each web site you visit.  It
works by combining the name of the site (usually the domain name shown in the
location bar) with a secret password (known only to you), using the HMAC/SHA256
algorithm.</p>

<p>The output of the algorithm is turned into a password by mapping each byte
of the HMAC value to a letter, digit, or punctuation mark.  Changing the name
of the site or the secret password will change the password you get.</p>

<ul class="doc">
 <li><strong>Site</strong>. The name of the site to create a password for.
 When you open KeyFish, it copies the domain name from the location bar, but
 you may type anything you want.  Choose a saved site from the menu just below,
 or select <strong>Copy URL</strong> to copy the URL from the browser's
 location bar.</li>

 <li><strong>Master key</strong>. This is where you enter your secret password.
 The password can be the same for many different sites, but should never be shared
 with anybody else.  Enable <i>Show Password</i> if you want to see what you typed.
 </li>

 <li><strong>Password</strong>. When you click <strong>Generate</strong>, the
 result is copied to this field, and also to the clipboard.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="dlabel">Advanced Settings</span></p>

<p>By default, KeyFish generates a long password using a mix of letters and
digits.

Some sites have special password rules that don't work with the default
settings, however.  If a site does not accept the password KeyFish gave you,
click open the <i>Advanced</i> pane.</p>

<ul class="doc">
  <li><strong>Use punctuation</strong>.  If this is checked, the passwords will
  contain punctuation characters as well as letters and digits.</li>

  <li><strong>Length</strong>. Chooses how many characters you would like
  KeyFish to use in each password it generates.</li>

  <li><strong>Salt</strong>. An extra value added to the site name.  This will
  change the password you get for a given site and master key.  You can usually
  leave this blank.</li>

  <li><strong>Format</strong>. For sites with very picky password rules, you
  can enter a password format here.  Use "A" to choose an uppercase letter, "a"
  to choose a lowercase letter, "*" to choose an arbitrary letter of either
  case, "?" to choose a punctuation mark, "1" to choose a digit, <i>e.g.,</i>
  "Aaa11?**11".

  To construct a password, KeyFish replaces these with characters of the
  specified kind based on the site name and secret key.

  You can usually leave this blank.</li>
</ul>

<p>To change the default settings, click <strong>Save Defaults</strong> (when
the Site field is empty).  Otherwise, you can choose <strong>Save
<i>sitename</i></strong> to save your specific settings for that site, or
<strong>Clear <i>sitename</i></strong> to revert to the defaults.</p>

<p>You can save your master key by clicking <strong>Save Master Key</strong>.
If you do this, your master key will be stored in the browser's local storage.
Anyone with physical access to your computer could steal your key if you do
this.  Click <strong>Clear Master Key</strong> to remove a saved master
key.</p>
